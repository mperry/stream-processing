Stream Processing
=================

This is an attempt to port stream processors (transducers) from the book "Functional Programming in Scala" chapter 15 from Scala to Java.

I have completed 15.3.1 and am continuing next with 15.3.2 (Ensuring Resource Safety).

The lack of higher order types means the extensible process type in 15.3.1 was completed only for the IO type.


Just done "Ensuring resource safety, 15.3.2", next "Single input processes".
